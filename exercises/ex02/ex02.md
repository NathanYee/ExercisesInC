# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?  
0,  
1,  
2,  
3,  
4  

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?
 * stack.c: In function ‘foo’:  
 * stack.c:22:12: warning: function returns address of local variable [-Wreturn-local-addr]
     return array;
 * This warning is hinting at the fact that we aren't handling our array properly. We won't be able to edit it in main.

3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get
some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.
 * Segmentation fault happens in the for loop in main because we are reading memory that we haven't allocated.

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?
 * They were commented out before. If I uncomment them they print the address of
 the array.

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!

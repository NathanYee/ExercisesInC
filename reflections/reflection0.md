# Reflection 0 - Software Systems - Nathan Yee

My team, Tangy Turtles, came together because we wanted to work on an Arduino synthesizer. We thought this project would teach us how to write good C, get started early, and learn how to work with limited compute resources, such as the atmega328.

## For example, how did you each share your individual goals and combine them to form team goals?

To communicate our learning goals to the rest of the team, we sat down and spent a few minutes writing our individual learning goals on post it notes. Then we went around and each talked about our particular learning goals. My post it learning goals said: get good at C, internalize memory management, do something robotics related, develop a comfortable work flow, collaborate and work in parallel, work with low resource mobile processors, and stay organized as as team.

Then, we made our team learning goals through suggestions and team feedback. We came up with these: stay organized as a team, make sure no one falls behind, make a cool thing that works pretty well.

## How did your team decide on a scrum master and divide other responsibilities?
Since our Casey was already scrum master and Shane wasn’t sure whether or not he was going to drop the class, we decided that I would be the scrum master, and that Carl would try to help me. So far, Carl and I have been getting a lot of help from Casey, but that should be less and less needed as time goes on.

## How did you decide what to include and omit from your sprint backlog?

Since we are currently unable to block diagram our Arduino synthesizer due the lack of C knowledge, we decided to get started with working on the development environment. This means things like getting the Arduinos out of our rooms, and uploading C versions of “blink”. We are also starting to think about the electrical aspect of our system. We have also started making shared resources such as Slack, Google Drive, and Github repositories.

## What are you still apprehensive about?

Frustration in learning / developing C in general. I also want to have enough time to work on another project after we finish the Arduino synthesizer.

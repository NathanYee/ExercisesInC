# Reflection 1 - Software Systems - Nathan Yee

## Written sprint reflection

These were my semester learning goals that I made during sprint 0:
* get good at C,
  * Read Head First C and worked through textbook examples to both internalize and have copy and paste-able examples of C code.
* internalize memory management
  * Head first C chapter 2
    Still not feeling the best here. I need to play around with memory a lot more.
* do something robotics related
  * No progress here. As I'm learning more about robotics in my other class, I will need to reevaluate this goal.
* develop a comfortable work flow
  * Set up atom with packages (vim-mode-plus, gcc-make-run) to help my development speed.
    As of right now, I'm finding these packages useful for developing speed.
    I am still looking for a proper debugger.
* collaborate and work in parallel
  * When our team is meeting, we are able to efficiently collaborate and work together.
    Of more concern, we haven't had any small meetings between less than 3 members of the team.
    I feel like more smaller meetings would allow us to work on the project at a much faster rate.
* work with low resource mobile processors
  * Our choice to use an Arduino is helping here.
    To gain more experience with low resource computers, I will push the Arduino to its absolute limits for our one-bit DAC.
* stay organized as team
  * We have stayed organized and have kept up consistent team communication and Trello usage.
    Stand-ups and next meeting planning have also proved necessary to stay together.
    As scrum master, I'm a little afraid that we aren't moving fast enough in both the textbook and the project.


Links to Head First C exercises

List the chapters you worked on during this sprint and provide links to your solutions (code, Markdown notes/answers, etc). If you did not complete any HFC exercises during this sprint, explain what you did instead. Since this work also lives within your ExercisesInC repository, you can use relative links (Links to an external site.) for portability.

Read:
* Chapter 1
  * ex01
    * Did all required tasks. I still don't know how to read assembly.
* Chapter 2
  * exo2
    * Spent 3ish hours on stack.c but not finished.
    * [ch2 work/notes](../hfc)
* Chapter 2.5
  * Read and did examples from textbook. No exercise work yet.

Exam question(s) and solution

One of the best ways to learn is to teach someone else, and a good way to check that you truly understand a concept is to pose your own question testing it. In each reflection, you will write (at least one) original, non-trivial question testing the material you read during the previous sprint, along with your solution. You should also indicate what reading(s) your question draws upon.

These questions may be helpful to use within your team to help prepare for sprint reviews. We will also share the compiled set of questions as a study guide for the midterm and final exams.

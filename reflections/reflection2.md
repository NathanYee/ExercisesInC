# Reflection 2 - Software Systems - Nathan Yee

# High level notes

The majority of work done in this sprint was done in the first week. I lost 4 days due to OCO's New York Trip. As a result, a lot of more recent exercises and readings aren’t done yet, but I should have the time to them in the upcoming days.

# Written sprint reflection

These were my semester learning goals that I made during sprint 0:

* Get good at C,

    * Starting to get a lot more comfortable about C in general. I am now a lot better at dealing with files, error handling, arguments, and makefile workflow. I feel like our project has taught me a lot about registers and not so much about C.

* Internalize memory management

    *  Was hoping to make more progress here. I still don't feel very strong with how C uses memory. I still made a small amount of progress - which is still progress.

* Do something robotics related

    * We started making use of Serial a lot more for our project. This will definitely help work with embedded systems later.

* Develop a comfortable work flow

    * Learned about makefiles. They are really useful.

* Collaborate and work in parallel

    * This sprint we were able to split our project into more parallel tasks. Let's continue the trend - divide and conquer! As long as we don’t get lost... 

* Work with low resource mobile processors

    * Not huge progress since last time. I want to make full use of the 16 bit timer to have much higher frequency precision.

* Stay organized as team

    * Falling a little behind here. We are still on the same page but it isn't as good as it used to be.

# Project

* Got Arduino to play sound of specified frequency

* Started serial communication from Arduino

* Started makefile for project

* Made song creator program

* Made file to stdout (serial) song player

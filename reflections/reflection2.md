Reflection 2 - Software Systems - Nathan Yee

# Written sprint reflection

These were my semester learning goals that I made during sprint 0:

* get good at C,

    * Read Head First C and worked through textbook examples to both internalize and have copy and paste-able examples of C code.

* internalize memory management

    * Head first C chapter 2

    * Still not feeling the best here. I need to play around with memory a lot more.

* do something robotics related

    * No progress here. As I'm learning more about robotics in my other class, I will need to reevaluate this goal.

* develop a comfortable work flow

    * Set up atom with packages (vim-mode-plus, gcc-make-run) to help my development speed. As of right now, I'm finding these packages useful for developing speed. I am still looking for a proper debugger.

* collaborate and work in parallel

    * When our team is meeting, we are able to efficiently collaborate and work together. Of more concern, we haven't had any small meetings between less than 3 members of the team. I feel like more smaller meetings would allow us to work on the project at a much faster rate.

* work with low resource mobile processors

    * Our choice to use an Arduino is helping here. To gain more experience with low resource computers, I will push the Arduino to its absolute limits for our one-bit DAC.

* stay organized as team

    * We have stayed organized and have kept up consistent team communication and Trello usage. Stand-ups and next meeting planning have also proved necessary to stay together.

# Project

* Got Arduino to play sound of specified frequency

* Started serial communication from Arduino

* Started makefile for project

* Made song creator program

* Made file to stdout (serial) song player

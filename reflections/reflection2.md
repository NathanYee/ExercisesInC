# Reflection 2 - Software Systems - Nathan Yee

## Written sprint reflection

These were my semester learning goals that I made during sprint 0:

* get good at C,

    * Read Head First C and worked through textbook examples to both internalize and have copy and paste-able examples of C code.

* internalize memory management

    * Head first C chapter 2

    * Still not feeling the best here. I need to play around with memory a lot more.
